        <p>Hey! My name is Chelsea Castillo. I was born and raised in New York, still living here. I am very interested in drawing and have been since I was kid. I've also been watching cartoons and anime shows for just as long. Some of my favorites are Teen Titans, Death Note and Sailor moon. I enjoy video games as well and love to draw characters from the video games I've played. Some of the characters I've drawn are Lara Croft, Spiderman, and a zombie from Plants vs. Zombies. Currently I am beginning to get back into watching anime. I'm hoping to become an animator in the future but am open to doing other things alongside as well.</p>
